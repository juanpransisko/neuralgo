*	Supervised

1. Initialize	-- OK
	1.1 Feature Space is 2-Dimensional	// Not necessary to implement
		1.1.1 One dimension per feature/attribute

	1.2 Initialize Output neurons (Each neuron means a category)
		1.2.1 Each neuron is predefined with a Category
		1.2.2 Each neuron is predefined with a small random Weight Vector
	
	1.3 Initialize Input data
		1.3.1 Each Input data has a corresponding Category
		1.3.2 Each Input data has a corresponding location point in the Feature Space
